# Customer_Journey
Need to get the best and shorter journey for each customer by the serves type and the region “Country”. 
1-	Clean the data
2-	Group the accounts by country and solution, then find the top five paths for each.
3-	Use the Decision Tree (DT) to determine the importance of the features to be used to present the next top four types of actions (e.g. email, call, etc.)
4-	Build a complete system. When the account information is added, the output should be as follows:
•	Top 4 actions by country
•	Top 4 actions by solution
•	Top 4 actions by country and solution
•	When the user adds an action, the top 4 actions should be recalculated using the new weights:
Using the DT build the best trip for the account to win or loss the opportunity.
